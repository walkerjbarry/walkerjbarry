- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @walkerjbarry
- ðŸ‘€ As a Front End Developer, I spend a great deal of time creating, 
troubleshooting, and maintaining (WCAG-compliant) web resources.  
My current work supports teachers and students, and is very satisfying. 
I'm intellectually curious, enthusiastic, really love learning, 
love the tech community, and love supporting my fellow (tech) professionals!
