- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @walkerjbarry
- ðŸ‘€. Following an immensely satisfying career in Environmental Science, I moved to a career in tech.  I work as a Web Developer for an organization 
- based in education. I spend a great deal of time creating, troubleshooting, and maintaining (WCAG-compliant) web resources.  My work supports teachers 
- and students, and is very satisfying. I'm intellectually curious, enthusiastic, really love learning, and love supporting my fellow career - switchers!
